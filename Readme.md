in the last website changes, i successfully removed the blue sidebar completely editing the dashboard file.   
for "removing the NaN problem in site" i went to the Dashboard file. i tried using this.setState and declaring a new function altogether, apart from searching for various ways to use useEffect and const to solve it. but to no avail.  
rest all is solved as per instructions provided and submitted earlier.
